HTML Comments
HTML comments are ignored by browsers if we comment in HTML code then codes are more readable to us. In lots of scenarios, we comment out a few elements for debugging purposes.

What are HTML Comments?
HTML comments are annotations or notes added in an HTML code that are not displayed by the browser. Just like comments in other languages HTML comments also serve the same purpose of providing code explanations, reminders, or instructions for developers who are collaborating on the same project.

HTML comments are not displayed on browsers while rendering the page making them useful to add additional information without affecting the appearance of the webpage. You can use the HTML comment tag to comment in the html code.
